# A forty-year career

The Silicon Valley narrative centers on entrepreneurial protagonists who are
poised one predestined step away from changing the world. A decade ago they were
heroes, and more recently they‚Äôve become villains, but either way they are
absolutely the protagonists. (Although, perhaps the role of protagonist is
expanding a bit.) Working within the industry, I‚Äôve worked with quite a few
non-protagonists who experience their time in technology differently: a period
of obligatory toil required to pry open the gate to the American Dream.

For some, this perspectives builds from the industry‚Äôs persistent, casual
discrimination and indifference to their lived experiences, but I‚Äôve found this
mindset common even among folks participating in the industry through the
vehicle of significant privilege. For a long time, my own career thinking
focused on reaching financial independence such that I would feel in control of
my future.

My father retired a few years ago, having worked as a professor at the
University of North Carolina Asheville for the significant majority of his adult
life. Since then I‚Äôve spent more time than expected reflecting on his retirement
and his preceding career. In particular, reflecting on the idea that my career
is something I can deliberately develop over a forty year horizon. Not four
IPOs, not fourteen two-year stints, but forty years.

It‚Äôs strange to realize that I lost sight of the forty-year career model,
because for a long time it was the only model I knew. Growing up, a white collar
career was my only reference point for participating in America‚Äôs dwindling
middle class. It never occurred to me that alternatives existed, despite the
majority of my aunts and uncles being entrepreneurs who started and worked in
their own small businesses. If you have the good fortune to start on the
long-term career conveyor belt, do your best to avoid tripping, and ride it to
success, home ownership and eventually retirement.

I did have exactly that good fortune to start on the conveyor belt, moving to
San Francisco at 23, but what I found wasn‚Äôt the career conveyor belt that I
expected. A different set of ideas reigned. Rather than careers, the zeitgeist
reminded me of studying Death of a Salesman in high school, ‚ÄúWhy, boys, when I
was seventeen I walked into jungle and when I was twenty-one I walked out. And
by God I was rich!‚Äù

Meeting my new coworkers, they structured their jobs as lottery tickets bought
with their lifeblood, trading tips on managing the symptoms of work until the
pearly gates of liquidity opened. We talked about coworkers and friends leaving
the industry with burnout and frustration. We talked about the engineer who
exercised their equity at a beloved startup and years later remained on an IRS
payment plan for taxes on equity in a defunct company.

At Digg, one mentor gave me the savvy advice that the fastest path to financial
success was working for four years at three different just-about-to-IPO
companies. A surefire way to retire by forty. (This is, for the record, pretty
good advice.)

At Uber, another friend told me I was looking at a frustrating situation the
wrong way, the way they viewed their work was, ‚ÄúEach day I walk into work, and
this slot opens up above my head, and money falls out of it into my hands, then
the slot closes. I go about my day, and the next day I come back, and the slot
reopens; more money falls out.‚Äù

This is a surprisingly dark way to view your life‚Äôs work. So as I pondered my
father‚Äôs retirement, the question that caught hold of me was: How would I
approach my work differently if focused on growth and engagement, and if I
measured eras not in equity and IPOs but instead in decades? I‚Äôd focus on a
small handful of things that build together, with each making the others more
impactful as they compound over time.

I‚Äôd focus on pace, people, prestige, profit and learning.

## Pace

The biggest barrier to a forty year career is burnout, and preventing burnout is
twofold. First, work on work you find meaningful. Second, manage your pace.

For a long time my default approach to any situation was to take personal
responsibility for it, and relatedly I have never worked a job where I didn‚Äôt
experience aspects of burnout. When I joined Stripe, one of my stated goals was
to approach my work in a way where I was doing my best work three, five, ten
years rather than peaking early. To work at a pace I could sustain, instead of a
blitz followed by a slow fizzling out.

Energy management is essential for your mental health. And, let‚Äôs be real, the
quality of your overall work is going to mirror your mental health, so getting
this right matters for your overall performance. Less obviously, building
continued depth and expertise requires remaining in the same environment for
multiple years, which makes long-term energy management an essential part of
skill development.

You will be continuously stymied until you learn to manage your pace.

There is no simple formula for what pace will be sustainable for you. It depends
on your obligations and environment outside of work, the particulars of your
role and team, and so many other factors.

There is, however, a simple formula for checking if what you‚Äôre doing is
sustainable: how long does it take on a vacation or weekend until you stop
feeling anxious, and how anxious do you start feeling when you think about
returning to work on Monday? If work anxiety is a constant companion, then
change your situation even if it feels like a step back in the short-term: your
success depends on sustained impact, not spikes.

## People

The biggest part of how I feel heading into the office each week, as well as
picking which office to head into over the course of my career, are the folks
I‚Äôll be working with. Your coworkers being an important part of your day-to-day
experience is unsurprising, and what I‚Äôve found increasingly true is that your
current coworkers also have an outsized influence on your career long after
you‚Äôve stopped working together.

These relationships are invaluable. They‚Äôll be the folks who enter you through
the streamlined referral process. They‚Äôll be the folks you can trust when they
tell you about a company‚Äôs culture. They‚Äôll be the folks that suggest your name
for an important role. They‚Äôll give you advice on difficult situations. They‚Äôll
be the folks who are advisors or investors in your startup, if you choose to
start one.

It requires some deliberate focus to approach each new role with the intention
of building the network of folks you know and work with well, but the
compounding value of doing so is huge. And to be fair, your relationships expand
beyond your coworkers: there are innumerable ways to meet and develop
relationships with folks. Positive relationships enable serendipity, and that
serendipity is the source of the most interesting opportunities.

If you‚Äôre struggling to build your network, spend time at a couple large
companies. You‚Äôll organically meet hundreds or thousands of folks, who will
scatter over time across the industry.

## Prestige

There is a well-worn refrain that Silicon Valley‚Äôs meritocracy is the great
equalizer, eliminating the role of prestige, but my lived experience is that
prestige matters a great deal. Companies start their searches for scarce roles
by recruiting from FAANG, and hiring processes bias outcomes to the advantage of
candidates at elite companies and colleges. This is done with good intent‚Äìwhy
wouldn‚Äôt you draft off the well-respected hiring processes at such companies and
well-respected curriculums at such colleges‚Äìand creates a pervasive career
lubricant for folks from such institutions.

If you‚Äôre a company leader, you have effectiveness and moral obligations to
reduce the role of prestige in your systems, and we do that by developing good
process. However, many desirable things that you want over the course of your
career will be gated by mechanisms that favor folks with prestige. You can be
justly upset by that fact, but upset is an insufficient catalyst for change, and
ultimately you‚Äôll have to develop your own prestige to gain access to those
scarce opportunities and resources.

The good news, though, is that prestige is imminently manufacturable! Some
examples I‚Äôve seen:

- Everyone who leverages success in one company or role into success at company
  or role that‚Äôs a bit bigger, a bit better known
- Can and Ranjan‚Äôs The Margins newsletter has connected them to venture
  capitalists, journalists and each email is now being read by many 1,000s of
  folks
- Cindy‚Äôs life-changingly good blog posts on infrastructure
- Julia‚Äôs zines are novel, innovative and totally unique, and each new one
  pushes her star a bit higher
- Julie writing and publishing The Making of a Manager
- Kelley‚Äôs appearance on 5 minute mentor, TWIML Talk, and with Rob on Software
  Engineering Daily (and of course Jeff‚Äôs work creating Software Engineering
  Daily which has been a vehicle of prestige creation for many, many folks)
- Sweta writing Post-mortems to the rescue for Increment‚Äôs Documentation issue
- Tramale speaking about the EM Kata at Abstractions Con
- Uma‚Äôs appearance on Software Engineering Daily podcast and speaking at
  Velocity
- This is something I‚Äôve gotten quite deliberate about myself over the last
  couple of years, starting with rebooting my gone-silent blog in 2016 (from 1
  post in 2015 to 76 in 2018), contributing to well-known and fast growing
  companies, speaking on my first podcast (thank you Intercom!) in 2018 and
  subsequently speaking on 11 more, speaking at half a dozen Bay Area company‚Äôs
  internal events, presenting at QConSF 2018, Velocity SJ 2019, and SRECon EMEA
  2019, and finally publishing An Elegant Puzzle.

This was a lot of work, and candidly I got the pace wrong in 2019 in particular,
working at a pace that‚Äôs been unsustainable for me, but the general premise
applies: there are accessible forms of prestige that you can build through
deliberate, hard work.

It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs possible. In retrospect, many folks‚Äô prestige seems
inevitable, but is the result of deliberate, intentional action over an extended
period. With each bit of prestige you accumulate, gathering the next bit gets
easier.

Prestige makes everything more attainable: a universal lubricant.

## Profit

For most folks, growing older also means being responsible for more people: a
partner, children, aging parents, extended families or local communities.
Similarly, folks get more deliberate about selecting roles as they‚Äôre further
into their careers, avoiding situations that likely to lead rapidly to burnout,
have toxic elements, or otherwise take a bad turn. Some folks I‚Äôve worked with
have encountered ageism as well, finding that folks are less and less interested
in hiring them as they get more experienced.

As you get deeper into your career, you‚Äôll move into increasingly senior roles,
and there are considerably fewer such roles available. Gone are the days of
leaving your job one day and jumping into another the next (although, yes, I
have found that folks generally underestimate their employability). I was
recently chatting with a well-respected senior engineering leader and she
mentioned her job process took ten months from start to finish! Admittedly, the
role she took is quite an amazing role, but still, ten months, and it‚Äôs not the
longest such story I‚Äôve heard.

The process takes longer, and time depends upon money. Consequently, the best
roles are only accessible if you‚Äôre already financially stable, whether it‚Äôs
stability from an existing role that‚Äôs you can interview from, or from savings
and investments that allow you to pause between roles to rest and explore.

Danielle Morrill‚Äôs Post-Startup Life describes the particular variant of
financial independence espoused by the Financial Independence, Retire Early aka
FIRE community, which is one approach to increasing your financial position over
time through passive investing and a high savings rate that‚Äôs particularly
accessible for younger folks working in technology. I won‚Äôt recap the entire
approach here, but generally I‚Äôve found it to be a simple, boring and
gimmick-free approach to increase your financial flexibility over time.

The key here isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgetting rich‚Äù, but creating the flexibility for yourself and
the folks who depend on you, because that flexibility allows you to be
deliberate about creating opportunities to invest into yourself and your career.

Financial security is a prerequisite to own your pace and learning.
